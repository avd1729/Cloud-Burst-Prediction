Cloudburst-Prediction-System
==============================

The challenge is to develop an accurate cloud burst prediction system that 
can effectively address these intense rainfall events' unpredictability and 
rapid onset caused by cumulonimbus clouds. It triggers flash floods and 
landslides, threatening lives and critical infrastructure. Weather prediction 
in India is elusive, making accurate forecasting of cloud bursts a challenge. 
Proactive measures must be taken to reduce their impact on lives and 
infrastructure. The goal is to predict cloud bursts precisely and promptly to 
minimize their impact
